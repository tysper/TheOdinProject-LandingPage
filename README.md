# TheOdinProject-LandingPage

<p>I did this project because I am currently doing The Odin's Project Course, and I really enjoyed the design and the concepts that I learnt when building this page. It helped me review some concepts and also to take things with more patient. Here are the principles applied to this project: </p>
<ul>
  <li>CSS Flexbox and Grid</li>
  <li>Design Patterns</li>
  <li>Clean Layout</li>
  <li>Utilities Concept</li>
</ul>
<p>Also this is the link for the preview of this project: <a href="https://tysper.github.io/TheOdinProject-LandingPage/">Landing Page</a></p>
